-----------
martinpihrt - IP Scanner<br/>
Improved IP Scanner with active local network discovery, network summary, structured device table, hostname and vendor hints, Gateway/This OSPy/Sensor candidate notes, and optional checks for common web ports 80, 443, 8080 and 8081.

martinpihrt - Weather-based Water Level<br/>
Added a Forecast details page that shows the last weather calculation input and result, including history, today and forecast rows with rainfall, average temperature, wind, humidity and the resulting water level adjustment.

martinpihrt - Signaling Examples<br/>
Updated the Signaling Examples plug-in to use a single complete signal list shared by code, settings, help, and README documentation. The settings page now refreshes status automatically and shows the last received signal in a separate auto-updating field.

martinpihrt - LCD Display, Wind Speed Monitor<br/>
Improved I2C bus cooperation between LCD Display and Wind Speed Monitor: Wind Speed Monitor now requests high-priority I2C access for PCF8583 counter setup and reads, while LCD Display uses low-priority short-timeout access so display scrolling does not delay time-sensitive measurements.
LCD Display now uses HD44780 display-shift commands for scrollable text that fits into the controller DDRAM buffer, reducing I2C traffic while preserving full long-text scrolling behavior for longer messages.
