Speed Monitor Readme

Tested in Python 3+

This plugin monitors and logs the speed of the Internet connection after a certain set interval. Download and upload speed are in Mbps. The response time (ping) is given in milliseconds. This extension arose as a whip on rogue Internet service providers. Many thanks: https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli.
