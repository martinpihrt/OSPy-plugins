Having a shared MQTT client simplifies configuration and lowers overhead on the OSPy process, network and broker. This plugin needs paho-mqtt. If not installed paho-mqtt, plugin installs paho-mqtt in to the system himself. On first use (if run installation paho-mqtt) please wait for status.

This means that one OSPy system can act as the control driver for secondary systems that also use OSPy and have the mqtt plugin installed. The control OSPy sends a list containing the on/off states of all stations. The secondary system receives the list and checks whether it is necessary to switch on one of its stations or switch it off and make the necessary changes. All irrigation plans are set on the main system and it records all running stations as if they were on the OSPy control system itself. There is no feedback from the secondary  OSPy, so the control system assumes that all stations are working as they should. If enabled logging in secondary OSPy, stations running on this secondary OSPy are also stored in the log. This provides a way to check if the station on the secondary is working properly. You must this OSPy switch to manual mode! MQTT core is required for this feature.')
